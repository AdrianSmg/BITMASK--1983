# BITMASK: 1983

The Cold War has gone silent, but the data has never been louder. As a Level 4 Telemetry Officer for the Soviet Union, you are the last line of defense against the American digital offensive. But the enemy does not attack with open declarations; they attack with noise, hidden signals, and phantom coordinates buried in static.

You sit before the ZASLON-4 Terminal. The air smells of ozone and cheap tobacco. Your orders are clear: Intercept. Identify. Isolate.

To find the truth, you must apply the MASK.

BITMASK: 1983 is a tactical terminal simulator where logic is your weapon. Using raw bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR...), you must filter out the American decoys and expose the nuclear payloads hiding in the code.
