Welcome to Bunker ZASLON-4, Comrade Operator #744.

I see you found the chair. Good. 
It is still warm from Operator #733. 
He was... "reassigned" to count snowflakes in Siberia this morning. 
Try to last longer than he did. At least until lunch.

Your mission is simple:
The Americans are flooding our frequencies with noise, propaganda, and jazz music.
Your terminal is the only filter between their lies and the Motherland.

They think they are safe.
But they do not know about the BITMASK protocol.

You are not here to listen, Comrade. 
You are here to UNMASK the enemy. 

We do not pay you to think. We pay you to make the MASK absolute.
Actually, we do not pay you at all. But the beet soup is free.

Are you ready to serve? [yes/no]
